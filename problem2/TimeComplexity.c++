// Create a time complexity analysis with O(-) notation
// For BFS, the time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph.
// For DFS, the time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph.
// For Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, the time complexity is O(V2) where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
